[00:00.08] I see that our world is over in one day
[00:03.19] Keep feeling no more will you be seen past it
[00:05.99] "I'll see you again" would be untrue that day
[00:09.00] Cannot be a wish to hold, we've got to hide it
[00:11.99] I see that our world is over in one day
[00:14.73] So let us come on
[00:16.32] Go on and keep playing sounds until it's over
[00:18.85] Making every tone louder so
[00:26.93] Surrounded by some shadows and a bit of light
[00:32.21] I open up my eyes, what's shown, unfamiliar room
[00:37.04] "We live in a world without a dark night
[00:40.99] And today, the world is endin' life"
[00:43.96] On such a day, you were brought into my sight
[00:49.70] "Do whatever you wanna do"
[00:51.75] Short answer to me's all you left
[00:54.04] Then wandered off in to
[00:56.67] Somewhere, the sound of you was fading afar, and soon
[01:02.65] I'm once again alone with me
[01:06.93] Sitting in the cool feel of stagnant air
[01:12.82] "All is soon let up, all known to be owned, tied up
[01:16.76] Recalling what ensued"
[01:18.69] Oh, what we got could lose all to woe, obtuse and waiting
[01:24.12] The life in a cold world, all the retentions
[01:27.37] And every heartache-woven melody will
[01:31.60] End today, so wave goodbye
[01:36.43] Alone inside his car, he drives along the route
[01:42.22] No sign of life, as he enters a city by himself
[01:47.15] He sees that tomorrow, an ending we shall reach
[01:52.58] What will a prayer do?
[01:55.34] When will a wish come true?
[02:17.69] Don't know what brought in the feeling
[02:20.36] What's got in keeps going, taking form of sound
[02:25.03] Piano notes of tones, a memory filled up in tones
[02:29.85] Following all that I'm feeling
[02:32.22] And tuning in our set of our breathing
[02:36.26] Stacked and let out our tones
[02:39.76] So warm and euphoric
[02:42.14] And nostalgic to me, ah
[02:46.32] And through it all, they keep on flowing through, ah
[02:58.49] "Once in the past, had all we could take
[03:01.08] Refraining to take out key old clues"
[03:04.04] Can a day lure, a tone got to let us feel old memories
[03:09.53] Key got soon let up, a silent piano
[03:12.67] I soon know what leak out, longer let-out of tears
[03:17.27] Now let's keep it louder so
[03:21.58] "All is soon let up, all known to be owned, tied up
[03:25.42] Recalling what ensued"
[03:27.49] Oh, what we got could lose all to woe, obtuse and waiting
[03:33.04] The life in a cold world, all the retentions
[03:36.18] And every heartache-woven melody will
[03:40.31] Sigh away from you and I
[03:45.00] "We now got caught in, so keen and owning
[03:47.94] Tied up in tone's all that assumes"
[03:50.75] Final day here is you and me, we see nobody else
[03:56.46] "When all is soon let up, all known to be owned
[03:59.68] Caught up in all we can remember, our tone got"
[04:04.04] Crossed and rise in a tune
[04:09.48] I see that our world is over in one day
[04:14.67] I see that our world is over in one day
[04:20.55] If we know the world is still around, I would stay
[04:23.78] And see an arrival of tomorrow
[04:26.35] Maybe you and me can depart and wish on it
[04:29.32] And then
