I see that our world is over in one day
Keep feeling no more will you be seen past it
"I'll see you again," would be untrue that day
Cannot be a wish to hold, we've got to hide it
I see that our world is over in one day
So let us come on
Go on and keep playing sounds until it's over
making every tone louder so
Surrounded by some shadows and a bit of light
I open up my eyes, what's shown, unfamiliar room
"We live in a world without a dark night,
and today, the world is endin' life"
On such a day, you were brought in to my sight
"Do whatever you wanna do"
Short answer to me's all you left
Then wandered off in to…
Somewhere, the sound of you was fading afar, and
soon…
I'm once again alone with me
Sitting in the cool feel of stagnant air
"All is soon let up, all known to be owned, tied
up,
recalling what ensued"
Oh, what we got could lose all to woe, obtuse
and waiting
The life in a cold world, all the retentions
and every heartache-woven melody will
"end today, so wave goodbye
Alone inside his car, he drives along the route
No sign of life, as he enters a city by himself
He sees that tomorrow, an ending we shall reach
What will a prayer do?
When will a wish come true?
Don't know what brought in the feeling
What's got in keeps going, taking form of sound
piano notes of tones, a memory filled up in
tones
Following all that I'm feeling
and tuning in our set of our breathing
Stacked and let out our tones
So warm and euphoric
and nostalgic to me, ah
And through it all, they keep on flowing
through, ah"
"Once in the past, had all we could take
refraining to take out key old clues"
Can a day lure, a tone got to let us feel old
memories
Key got soon let up, a silent piano
I soon know what leak out, longer let-out of
tears
Now let's keep it louder so
"All is soon let up, all known to be owned, tied
up,
recalling what ensued"
Oh, what we got could lose all to woe, obtuse
and waiting
The life in a cold world, all the retentions
and every heartache-woven melody will
"Sigh away from you and I
"We now got caught in, so keen and owning,
tied up in tone's all that assumes"
Final day here is you and me, we see nobody else
"When all is soon let up, all known to be owned,
caught up in all we can remember, our tone got"
crossed and rise in a tune
I see that our world is over in one day
I see that our world is over in one day
If we know the world is still around, I would
stay
And see an arrival of tomorrow
Maybe you and me can depart and wish on it
and then…
